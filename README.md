TipCalculator
=============
What started out being a simple tip calculator has 3 other functions added to it as samples for demonstrating my understanding of various parts of Android. 
1) Tip: Calculates total to be paid by each person depending on the total bill, % tip and number of people.
2) Web: Launches an activity with a WebView for loading websites whose URL is taken as input.
3) Dial: Calls an intent to dial a preset phone number (Bentley University) from the phone's dialer.
4) Map: Calls an intent to focus on a preset address (again, Bentley University) from a map application (by default, Google Maps).
